# Study Code #

## Introduction ##
This repository is composed of the code I created during my self-study progress.
Most of the files are implementation of Algorithms and Data Structures.


Most of the time, C++ would be used. Since it is the language that I will used most
often at my university, I should spend some time practicing with it. Other languages
are Java or Python. I am planning to add some JavaScript visualization in the future.

## List of Algorithms ##

    * Generating binary sequences [C++]
    * Generating permutations [C++]
    * Generating possible sums of a number [C++]
