# Study Code #

## Introduction ##
This repository is composed of the code I created during my self-study progress.
Most of the files are implementations of Algorithms and Data Structures.


Most of the time, C++ would be used. Since it is the language that I will used
most often at my university, I should spend some time practicing with it.
Other languages are Java, Python and Pascal. I am planning to add some
JavaScript visualization in the future.
